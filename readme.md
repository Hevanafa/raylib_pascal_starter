# Raylib + Pascal Starter

Requires the **Ray4Laz** Raylib bindings obtained from here: https://github.com/GuvaCode/Ray4Laz

Copy the `raylib.dll` obtained from `ray4laz/libs/x86_64-win64` folder to your project folder.

In **Project Options** > **Compiler Options** > **Paths**, add the following in the **other unit files** textbox:

`..\ray4laz-5.5_fixA\source;..\ray4laz-5.5_fixA\package`

The list depends on the version of Ray4Laz that you've downloaded.
